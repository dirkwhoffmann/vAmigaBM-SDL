## What is vAmiga? 

vAmiga is an Amiga emulator that has been developed as a native application for macOS. It is as pretty stable emulator by now and close to a 1.0 release. 

## What is vAmiga Bare Metal? 

vAmigaBM is a fork of this project with an emphasis on bringing vAmiga to a variety of other platforms. The emulator will be based on SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to limit OS specific code to a minimum. As a result, vAmiga BM will be portable with little effort to almost any hardware platform supporting this framework.

## Is it worth downloading vAmiga Bare Metal yet?

No. This project is in a very early stage.
